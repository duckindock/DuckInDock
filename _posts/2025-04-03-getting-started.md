## 🔹 Get Started with Git & GitHub

Each post includes a GitHub repository. If you're new to Git and GitHub, don't worry—we’ve got you covered!

### Install Git

If Git isn’t installed on your system yet, you’ll need to install it first.

For **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**, run:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

For **MacOS**, use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install git
```

For **Windows**, download the installer from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the setup instructions.

Stay tuned for future posts where we’ll dive deeper into Git and GitHub workflows! 🛠️

## 🐳 Setting Up Docker

We'll use Docker for managing development environments. If you don’t have it installed yet, follow the official installation guide based on your OS:

- [**Install Docker on Linux**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [**Install Docker on Mac**](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [**Install Docker on Windows**](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

For Linux, you can install it manually by running:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Make sure Docker is running:

```sh
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

More Docker tutorials will be posted soon, so stay connected! 🐳
